# how to use Multer to deal with file 
1. Multer configuration
    multer.diskStorage() // store the file in the file system, can be local folder or S3 storage place 
    multer.memoryStorage() // store the file in memoery tile, in other word, convert file to binary data 

2. upload.sing(<the_name_of_file_field_from_request>)/array()
    it will generate a req.file object which can be used later 
    the req.file content would be different, which depends on which multer configuration you choose 

In this project, I set the image type be Buffer. That means I store binary data type of image file in mongodb. 
When client need the image data, I will convert binary to base64 string using .toString('base64') method.
